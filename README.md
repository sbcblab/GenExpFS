# Analysis and Comparison of Feature Selection Methods Towards Performance and Stability

> This project aims to evaluate and compare Feature Selection algorithms. 

The amount of gathered data is increasing at unprecedented rates for machine learning applications
such as natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. This increase implies a
higher number of samples and features; thus, some problems regarding highly dimensioned data
arise. The curse of dimensionality, small samples, noisy or redundant features, and biased data
are among them. Feature selection is fundamental to dealing with such problems. It reduces the
data dimensionality by selecting the most relevant and less redundant features. Thus, reducing the
computational cost, improving accuracy, and enhancing the dataâ€™s interpretability to machine learning
models and domain experts. However, there are several selectors options from which to choose.
This work compares some of the most representative algorithms from different feature selection
groups regarding a broad range of measures, several datasets, and different strategies from diverse
perspectives. We employ metrics to appraise selection accuracy, selection redundancy, prediction
performance, algorithmic stability, selection reliability, and computational time of several feature
selection algorithms. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms and can
guide their application.
